I've had a fascination with the web since I was able to use a computer. I was struck not only by *how much* content there existed on the web, but *how* it came to life...  I remember spending hours and hours as a preteen surfing through boy band fan websites, loving every quiz, video, interactive feature -- my stack of Teen Beat magazines were lifeless by comparison.

I currently work in online content, writing articles and newsletters. However, once again, I've found myself drawn to *how* this content can come to life, and I'm thrilled to start the journey of software engineering to learn just that.
